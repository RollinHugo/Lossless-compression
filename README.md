# Lossless-compression

Lossless compression implementation in Java. The following algorithms have been programmed :

- Burrows Wheeler transformation
- Compression by dictionary
- MTF transformation
- Huffman trees (8 and 16 bits)
- RLE compression

Combine theses method to analyse data and determine an optimal compression process
